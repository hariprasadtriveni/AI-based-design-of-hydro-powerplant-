# AI-based-design-of-hydro-powerplant-
Project based on design of hydro powerplant using django framework
Project is build using html,css,javascript for frontend and for backend connectivity I used django framework
**Project details**
  1) Homepage which has some imput boxes related hydro powerplant, what inputs we needed to collect/required before we build hydro powerplant
  2) once we submit all input, it take us to different page. Here you will get to see 3 sections those are civil structure, mechanical structure, hydroelectrical structure.
  3) Once you click on any one of section it will generate output. Different section will generate different output

  **How output looks?**
    - Page will be going to have design. so this design is based on section which you have choosen.
    - These design are AI based generative design. Basically seeing the design you will get an idea how the structure looks like.
    - Below the design You will get to see some lines of text. This text will be describing structure with respective of inputs submitted.
    - Text will be describing how we need to construct/plan hydro powerplant like this much budget is required, you needed this type of location, how water flow should be there. It depends on section        which is choosen, If you clicked on mechanical structure output will generated on mechanical components and text will be decribing about mechanical components.
  

  **Output**
  Hydroelectric structure output
